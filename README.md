# Whio

_Twitter for superusers._

## Stage 0: The Name

Whio is a duck native to New Zealand with blue feet. Also the domain name
field for whio is pretty empty. The short `wh.io` is being parked on but
may be available.

## Stage 1: Concrete Ideas

Look at the [issue list](https://github.com/passcod/whio/issues).

This contains descriptions of everything I would want in the hypothetical
twitter client I name "Whio". A bunch of these come from other people.
Some of these might not make it in the hypothetical event I actually get
around to making this thing, but it's a good way to start putting it all
together. Feel free to:

- Contribute features. These *must not* be available currently in either
  the official Twitter web and mobile clients or TweetDeck. Improvements
  on features that *are* is acceptable but the line is blurry. I'll close
  issues liberally for these reasons and more, and lock liberally as well.

- Steal features. If you're writing a Twitter client, a client for another
  social medium, or even an entire platform, social or notâ€¦ and you find
  one or more of these features interesting, go right ahead and use them.
  Chime in the issue thread if you can to tell me about it and/or offer
  feedback. If you steal *ALL* the features (and make your own "Whio"),
  I'd be happy to contribute code! Hiring me would be ace.

If one of the features is pulled from you and you're not happy to see it
here, drop me a line at `whio@passcod.name`, or comment on the issue, or
[tweet at me](https://twitter.com/passcod). I can remove any mention of
you and paraphrase the idea over, or I can remove the feature entirely,
but I can't offer any guarantee it won't pop up later organically, sorry!
